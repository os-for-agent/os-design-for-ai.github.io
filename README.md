# AgenticOS 2026: Operating Systems Design for AI Agents

(Co-located with ASPLOS 2026)

AI agents are rapidly evolving from experimental prototypes to always-on services that autonomously plan, invoke external tools, collaborate, and continuously interact with their environment. This paradigm shift fundamentally challenges existing operating system (OS) abstractions—such as processes, threads, files, sockets, and resource controllers—which were never designed to manage dynamic, semantically complex, and adaptive agent-based workloads. To effectively support AI agents at scale, operating systems themselves must become "agentic," proactively adapting their abstractions and resource management policies to the semantic needs and dynamic behaviors of agents.

The **AgenticOS** workshop seeks original position papers and experience reports exploring OS-level mechanisms specifically designed for AI agent workloads. We aim to identify, discuss, and define new OS primitives and kernel mechanisms that enable secure isolation, dynamic resource scheduling, efficient state management, and real-time observability tailored explicitly to the unique characteristics of agent-based systems.

### **Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):**

- **New OS abstractions** for agent execution (process/container/multikernel enhancements)
- **Dynamic sandboxing and lightweight runtimes** optimized for securely running agent-generated tasks
- **Fine-grained, semantics-aware resource management** and scheduling tailored to dynamic, multi-agent workloads
- **Long-lived state abstractions** for efficiently managing agent context, prompts, and episodic state
- **eBPF-driven kernel extensions** for real-time observability, adaptation, and constraint enforcement in agent workloads
- **Compiler–OS co-design** enabling adaptive just-in-time (JIT) compilation strategies for agent execution
- **GPU and accelerator virtualization** approaches for secure, efficient execution of AI agents at scale
- **Security and isolation mechanisms** for dynamically invoked tools, code, and data flows generated by agents
- **Agents managing systems**, including kernel parameter tuning, resource orchestration, anomaly detection, failure recovery, and dynamic policy updates

### **Submission guidelines:**

We solicit two types of contributions:

- **Extended abstracts for talks**: 1–2 pages (excluding references), describing early-stage ideas, position statements, ongoing research, or demonstrations. Accepted submissions will be presented as workshop talks.
- **Short/position papers**: Up to 6 pages (excluding references), presenting more developed concepts, research results, experience reports, or comprehensive position papers. Accepted papers will be invited for presentations and will have the opportunity for archival publication in ACM Digital Library proceedings, subject to author preference.

All submissions must follow ACM’s double-column conference format. The review process will be single-blind, with each submission receiving at least two reviews. Authors of accepted submissions can choose whether their paper will appear in the formal ACM proceedings or remain unpublished (extended abstracts will appear only on the workshop website unless otherwise requested).
